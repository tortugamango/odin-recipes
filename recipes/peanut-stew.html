        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can diced tomatoes</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté aromatics:</strong> Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Stir in garlic, ginger, and chili, cooking for another 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice it up:</strong> Add cumin, paprika, cinnamon, and cayenne. Stir to coat the onions and cook the spices for 1 minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Add veggies:</strong> Toss in the sweet potato and bell pepper. Stir well, then add the canned tomatoes (with juices) and mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanut butter magic:</strong> In a bowl, whisk together the peanut butter with a cup of broth until smooth. Pour this mixture into the pot along with the remaining broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 20–25 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and the stew has thickened.</li>
        <li><strong>Add greens:</strong> Stir in kale or spinach and cook for another 5 minutes until wilted. Season with salt, pepper, and lime juice to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle into bowls and top with chopped cilantro and roasted peanuts if desired. Serve with warm rice, flatbread, or enjoy on its own.</li>
